Granularity bit: Specifies the units with which the LIMIT field is
interpreted. When thebit is clear, the limit is interpreted in units of one
byte; when set, the limit is interpreted in units of 4 Kilobytes

DPL (Descriptor privilege level): Used by the protection mechanism

segment-present bit: If this bit is zero, the descriptor is not valid for
use in address transformation; the processor will signal an exception when a
selector for the descriptor is loaded into a segment register. Operating 
systems that implement segment-based virtual memory clear the present bit in 
either of these cases:
- When the linear space spanned by the segment is not mapped by the paging
mechanism
- When the segment is not present in memory

Accessed bit: The processor sets this bit when the segment is accessed;
i.e., a selector for the descriptor is loaded into a segment register or
used by a selector test instruction. Operating systems that implement
virtual memory at the segment level may, by periodically testing and
clearing this bit, monitor frequency of segment usage.

Two types of Descriptor tables
1. The global Descriptor table (GDT)
LGDT and SGDT instructions give access to GDTR(GDT register)

2. A local Descriptor table (LDT)
LLDT and SLDT instructions give access to LDTR(LDR register)

Index: Selects one of 8192 descriptors in a descriptor table. The processor
simply multiplies this index value by 8 (the length of a descriptor), and
adds the result to the base address of the descriptor table in order to
access the appropriate segment descriptor in the table.

Table Indicator: Zero Indicate GDT, one indicate LDT

Requested Privilege level: Used by the protection mechanism.

Informations of the descriptor are stored in segment registers(e.g., CS, SS DS, ES, FS, GS) These registers are stored in two types of program instructions
1. Direct load instructions: MOV, POP, LDS, LSS, LFS
2. Implied load instructions: CALL, JMP
Because most instructions refer to data in segments whose selectors have
already been loaded into segment registers, the processor can add the
segment-relative offset supplied by the instruction to the segment base
address with no additional overhead.
