Protection
five aspects of protections
1. TYpe checking
2. Limit checking
3. Restriction of addressable domain
4. Restriction of procedure entry points
5. Restriction of instruction set

Segment: The segment is the unit of protection, and segment descriptors stores protection parameters. Protection checks are performsed automatically by the CPU when the selector of a segment descriptor is loaqed into a segment register and with every segment access. Segment registers hold the protection parameters of the currently addressabnle segments.

Type field of descriptor 

6.1. Type checking
Type checking can be used to detect programming errors that would attempt
to use segments in ways not intended by the programmer. The processor
examines type information on two kinds of occasions:
1.When a selector of a descriptor is loaded into a segment register.
Certain segment registers can contain only certain descriptor types;
for example:
-The CS register can be loaded only with a selector of an executable
segment.
-Selectors of executable segments that are not readable cannot be
loaded into data-segment registers.
-Only selectors of writable data segments can be loaded into SS.
2.When an instruction refers (implicitly or explicitly) to a segment
register. Certain segments can be used by instructions only in certain
predefined ways; for example:
-No instruction may write into an executable segment.
-No instruction may write into a data segment if the writable bit is
not set.
-No instruction may read an executable segment unless the readable bit
is set.

F                                   386 Trap Gate

6.2. Limit checking
The limit field of a segment descriptor is used by the processor to prevent programs from addressing outside the segment. The processor's interpretation of the limit depends on the setting of the G(Granularity) bit.
When G = 0: limit range from 0 to 0xFFFFF(2^20 - 1 or 1 megabyte)
When G = 1: Limit range from 0xFFF(2^12 - 1) to 0xFFFFFFFF(2^32 - 1 or 4 gigabytes)

For all types of segments except expand-down data segments, the value of
the limit is one less than the size (expressed in bytes) of the segment. The
processor causes a general-protection exception in any of these cases:
-Attempt to access a memory byte at an address > limit.
-Attempt to access a memory word at an address ≥limit.
-Attempt to access a memory doubleword at an address ≥(limit-2).
